For extra credit.
On week ten, I fix my Android smart phone that was damaged. I bought a program (mobile go) on internet to fix the phone. I used good to erase every data on phone and used mobile go program that I bought to install the android operating system on the phone. I gave Mathew Harmon, the lecturer a hard copy. I am unable to attach this file to this document because it wonâ€™t accept picture or graphic documents
