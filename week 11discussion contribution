During the last week I researched Window Managers and the libraries associated with enlightenment. Enlightenment is a composite window manager for the X Window System. Enlightenment can be used in conjunction with programs written for GNOME or KDE. Enlightenment is designed to be a full fledge desktop shell based of the (EFL) libraries. The (EFL) libraries are a very important part of our desktop environment. The EFL libraries cover a range of functionality from main-loop, to graphics, scene graphs, networking, widgets, data storage, IPC and more. This link is to an article that I found informative and enjoyable to read, I think the class as a whole would benefit from reading it. Enlighten your desktop with Elive
If anyone has any questions or comments feel free to respond.
