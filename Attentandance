Assignments and examination and extra mark Grade justifications
In each of the assignments and the examinations I submitted, I deserve  Grade A . 
I attended all the lectures and I understood what the lecturer taught in the class. At the same time, I read the text book for the class.  I took note in class, also made some personal research on each of the lecture topics in many available resources.  I read many available materials related to this class in order to understand the weekly topics.
I participated in the class group discussion and get together with my group members to do the group assignments.
