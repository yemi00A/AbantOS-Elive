	what I learnt in the video- “Learning how to Learn.”
There are two modes of learning and Thinking; the focus mode , which is concentrating on things  which are familiar while Diffused mode, is a relaxed mode of thing in which ones thoughts are free to wander.
Sometimes we may not  desire doing/ learning something, go through it, come back to it and just start. The discomfort sometimes goes away and later lead to satisfaction.
When we learnt new thing, we should take time to rest, then come back to it and recall whatever you learnt earlier; this is very important. Cramming information in a single day is inefficient way of learning, avoid it. In fact is like building house without a plan.
Revisiting and practicing  what we learn is very important in learning process  and   helpful in mastering the subject matter of whatever we learnt. 
Research show that speed repetition is the best way to build and strengthen synaptic connections. Sleeping is also important because it help clears the metabolic toxins from the brain after a day of “brain use”. It is very important to have a sufficient rest by sleeping after learning something new. It was shown that exercising and/ or being in a rich social environment helps ours brain to produce new neurons. 
One shouldn’t isolate oneself, it is important that we stay very active and spare time for exercise, which includes general physical activities with friends on regular basis.
